      <p>The most common call category during the year of 2017 is related to updating pet information and the 2nd most common call category is Stray dog-at-large. However, stray dog-at-large merely means whoever called saw a stray dog without picking it up, and the animal service at Miami-Dade county went to the reported place without necessarily retrieved the dog. On the other hand, stray dog pick-up meaning the person who called actually got the dog. On top of that, people love dogs and stray dog can be a big concern for animal lovers. Therefore, we will be focusing on stray dog pick-up for the story and explore how their situation looks like within Miami-Dade county.</p>

      <p>Stray Dog Count in Miami has seen a notable decline in recent years. In a closer look to how long it takes to place these stray dogs, we’ve found the average amount of placement days per district. District 4 (North Miami) had a significantly longer time placing stray dogs than the other districts, estimating 7.2 days in total. District 10 (Kendall, Westchester, and Fontainebleau) had the shortest turnaround time, averaging at 1.9 days for stray dog placement. While the other districts mostly ranged around the 2 days return period (District 4 and District 6 excluded), the shorter the turnaround time, the better it’ll be for our furry friends.</p>

      <p>The animals picked-up from the 3-1-1 calls make their way to the Miami-Dade County Animal Services Center. The center's mission includes saving lives, protecting animals against cruelty, and reuniting lost pets with their owners. As part of their mission, the center offers many services, including pet adoption, animal licenses, and vaccinations.</p>

      <p> The center has taken in over <strong>41,000</strong> dogs in the last 3 year.</p>

      <p>To help with the intake of stray dogs, there are several non-profit organizations throughout Miami-Dade that are also helping stray or unwanted dogs find a home. Through the donations and with the help of volunteers, these organizations provide a foster home and assist with medical needs. </p>
