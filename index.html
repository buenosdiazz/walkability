        <p>According to Walkscore, Miami is the 4th most walkable large city in the US with 399,457 residents. Miami's most walkable neighborhoods include: Downtown, Wynwood-Edgewater and Little Havana. In this project we breakdown these three
          neighborhoods by zipcodes and explore the walkability scores for each zipcode as well as the number of pedestrian related 311 calls reported in that zipcode for 2018.</p>
